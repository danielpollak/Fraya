While taking AP computer science in high school, my teacher casually mentioned that Android was written in the language we were learning that year. I asked for a tablet for Christmas and got to work on the two things I could think of for a project: a morse converter and a conway's game of life simulator. There are two passwords to give you access to two functionalities. The first is "morse", the second is "game".
The app's name was my stab at a generic tech company name.
Hope you like it. To install, flash it onto an android phone in [developmer mode](https://www.howtogeek.com/129728/how-to-access-the-developer-options-menu-and-enable-usb-debugging-on-android-4.2/) from Android Studio.
